## Project Overview


OnaSpark is a comprehensive water management system designed to provide robust solutions for water quality assessment, incident tracking, and organizational management. Developed with a focus on precision, efficiency, and scalability, the platform addresses critical challenges in water resource management.

## Core Functionalities

### Water Quality Evaluation System

The water quality evaluation module is the cornerstone of OnaSpark, offering a sophisticated approach to monitoring and analyzing water parameters:

#### Comprehensive Parameter Tracking

OnaSpark monitors four critical categories of water quality parameters:

1. **Microbiological Parameters**
   - Detailed tracking of fecal coliforms
   - Nematode egg count analysis
   - Precise microbiological risk assessment

2. **Physical Parameters**
   - pH level monitoring
   - Suspended matter (MES) analysis
   - Electrical conductivity (CE) measurements

3. **Chemical Parameters**
   - Biochemical Oxygen Demand (DBO5)
   - Chemical Oxygen Demand (DCO)
   - Chloride concentration tracking

4. **Toxic Element Detection**
   - Heavy metal monitoring
   - Trace element analysis
   - Comprehensive toxicity assessment
